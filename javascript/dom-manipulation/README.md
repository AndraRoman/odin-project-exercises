#DOM Manipulation

A fake restaurant site with tabbed content. Assignment page at [http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/manipulating-the-dom-with-jquery](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/manipulating-the-dom-with-jquery). Since I already created elements from scratch in the calculator project, I'm deviating from the assignment to learn about progressive enhancement instead. View [here](https://rawgit.com/cdouglass/odin-project-exercises/master/javascript/dom-manipulation/tabs.html).

##Features
* JQuery inspects fragment identifier, allowing tags to be bookmarked
* Without JS, all tabbed content is viewable in sequence, with links at the top to skip to the desired section
* Helpful noodle-cooking tips

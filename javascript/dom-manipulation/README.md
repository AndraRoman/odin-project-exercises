#Dom Manipulation

A fake restaurant site with tabbed content. Assignment page at [http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/manipulating-the-dom-with-jquery](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/manipulating-the-dom-with-jquery). Since I already created elements completely from scratch in the calculator project, I'm deviating from the assignment to learn about progressive enhancement instead. Without JS, tabbed content is viewable in sequence, with links at the top to skip to the desired section.

== Social Network

A practice app implementing a basic social network. Specifications at http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/final-project.

Features friendships, posts, and comments; users see a feed of their friends' posts. Uses Devise and `omniauth-facebook` for sign-in. Uses Paperclip for user profile photo upload. Demo on [Heroku](https://pure-meadow-87105.herokuapp.com/).  Unstyled and rough around the edges as yet, but the test suite is extensive.

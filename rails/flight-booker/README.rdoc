== Flight Picker

A toy app for practicing nested forms, following http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/building-advanced-forms.

A user can select origin and destination airports and a date in the future and view a list of all flights meeting these conditions. The user can then select one flight and create a booking for up to four passengers.

== Limitations

* Each passenger object has exactly one booking, so if one person wishes to make multiple flights they will have multiple passenger objects.
* The app does not account for flights having finite capacity. 
* Search returns only single flights, not combinations with transfers.
* Once a booking is made, there is no way to cancel it.

Clone of [http://touchstonejs.io/](http://touchstonejs.io/) as an exercise in building a page with background images and gradients. Assignment page at [http://www.theodinproject.com/html5-and-css3/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients](http://www.theodinproject.com/html5-and-css3/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients), though I cloned a different website since the assigned [www.apple.com](http://www.apple.com) had changed and no longer featured a gradient. Only tested in Firefox; responsive and interactive features not implemented.

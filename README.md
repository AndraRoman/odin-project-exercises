#The Odin Project Exercises#

In which I work through, and sometimes overthink, the exercises in [http://www.theodinproject.com/](http://www.theodinproject.com/) starting with the Ruby Programming course.

##Ruby Programming##

###Building Blocks Project###
* Caesar cipher
* Stock picker (given an array of stock prices ordered by date, choose the best dates to buy and sell, without shorting)
* Substring counter (using Rabin-Karp algorithm)

###Advanced Building Blocks Project###
* Bubble sort
* Fake enumerable methods (DTRT when called with or without a block)

###Object-Oriented Programming Project###
* Tic-tac-toe (with AI; allows arbitrary board size, though AI is impractically slow for board larger than 3x3)
* Mastermind (with AI)

###Serialization and Working with Files###
* Hangman

###Ruby on the Web###
* Toy server and browser

###Recursion###
* Fibonacci sequence
* Merge sort

###Data Structures and Algorithms###
* Searching binary trees (with red-black tree, though deletion is not implemented)
* Knight's path (coming soon; note this is NOT the knight's tour)

#The Odin Project Exercises#

In which I work through, and sometimes overthink, the exercises in [http://www.theodinproject.com/](http://www.theodinproject.com/) starting with the Ruby Programming course.

##[Ruby Programming](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming)##

* Fake enumerable methods (DTRT when called with or without a block)

###[Object-Oriented Programming Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/oop)###
* Tic-tac-toe (with AI; allows arbitrary board size, though AI is impractically slow for board larger than 3x3)
